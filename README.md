Machine Learning Proof-of-Concept
===============================================

This challenge serves as the basis for the technical interview.

Please have a look at the challenge and tell us **before starting the challenge**
- if any aspect is unclear to you,
- if you want to amend the challenge to better reflect your skills,
- if you want to change / reduce the scope to better fit your time schedule,
- how much effort in your estimate you will need to finish it, and
- when you can finish the task.

We understand that you have other priorities and can not commit full time to completing the challenge.
Thus spend your time economically:
- You don't need to waste time on debugging. If it doesn't work, leave it.
- If anything is unclear, write us instead of guessing what we expect. 
- You don't need to learn a new technology. We can adapt the challenge 
  so that you can solve it with what you already know.

Don't hesitate to write us if you have any questions during the challenge.

Goals
--------

### Coding challenge

- Implement an image classifier in ResNet on CIFAR-10. 
- Framework: PyTorch. 
- Target: minimum 90% accuracy. 

### Pre-interview preparations

- Think about a past machine learning project. 
  What were the customer requirements? 
  What were the (technical and non-technical) challenges? 
- Explain a ML paper published in the last six months (or pre-print) in detail. 
  Compare with similar paper. What are the benefits and drawbacks?
- Fill out the [Self-evaluation matrix](./Self-Evaluation.md).


Deliverables
------------

- [ ] Code (Google Collab, Jupyter notebook or vanilla Python code) for creating the image classifier.
- [ ] Documentation how to run the code.
- [ ] [Self-evaluation matrix](./Self-Evaluation.md).
